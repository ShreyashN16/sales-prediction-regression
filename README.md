## 🌟 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **Regression Models** (Linear, Polynomial, and Multi-Feature) can be used to **predict sales based on marketing spend** across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels.

It’s the foundation of predictive analytics — **using past data to forecast future outcomes**.

---

## 🧠 What is Regression?

Regression is a **supervised machine learning technique** used to find the relationship between independent variables (like marketing budget) and a dependent variable (like sales).  

In simple words — **it helps you predict how changes in one factor affect another**.  
For example:  
> “If I increase my TV ad spend by ₹10,000, how much will my sales go up?”

### Common Types of Regression:
- **Linear Regression:** Fits a straight line between inputs and output.  
- **Polynomial Regression:** Fits a curved line for more complex patterns.  
- **Multi-Feature Regression:** Uses multiple inputs (TV, radio, newspaper, etc.) for prediction.
